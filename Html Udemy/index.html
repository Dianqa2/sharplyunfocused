  <h1>Diana's first attempt at writting code!</h1>
  <h2>Welcome ( •̀ᴗ•́ )و ̑̑</h2>

  <h3>This is a blog about Diana's
  attemp to learn things for the sake of learning and for the sake of
  sharing that learning progress. Possibly it's also a cry for finding people
that like to bully distracted minds and hold them accountable when they stray
for whatever promises I have made (to you or myself hehe).
<br> Come at me dear reader, for I bark but get distracted and forget to bite.

  <p> <h4>Me and my constant blaberring about wanting to do photography.</h4>
    I have always been mesmerized with Visual expression. Especially I
    tend to be completely taken back by what I see in real life.
     With a camera I hope to, by some miracle,
capture what I see and either save it as mine or show it to whomever willing
to see. <br>
I don't want to get into a self-deprecating mode and
tell you that my vision is in no way special and that my photos are just regular
snaps everyone can do. I guess by sharing, I am pushing through some
nihilistic walls i build around my art, and I say fuck it, look what
I am looking at. I find it cool. Precious gems I'm eager to show others and
them understand why optimistic nihilism is a thing.
Simply, what I see I feel precious. And I wish to capture that.
Ink it into my memory, save it a screen infront of my eyes, feel
that exhilaration running through my body.
<br>
It doesn't work that way. But, a fraction of it can possibly be captured
through various crafts (?)
I chose mainly photography, because it's easiest to
do (in other words,
I lack necessary talent + necessary practice hours in other fields).
What I mostly like about cinematography (that is my ultimate dream to tap my
fingers into that) is the rawness of colors and sounds. My job is Simply
to capture a moment that best transaltes this complex dance of features.
I want to elaborate more on what I feel excited to grab the camera and point
at my target. <a href='My Photos.html'>Let me show you what I mean</a>.
